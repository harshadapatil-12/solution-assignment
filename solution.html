	<h3><div>1.What is BYOD?</div></h3>

	Answer:BYOD (bring your own device) is the increasing trend toward employee-owned devices within a business. Smartphones are the most common example but employees also take their own tablets, laptops and USB drives into the workplace.


BYOD is part of the larger trend of IT consumerization, in which consumer software and hardware are being brought into the enterprise. BYOT (bring your own technology) refers to the use of consumer devices and applications in the workplace. More specific variations on the term include bring your own computer (BYOC), bring your own laptop (BYOL), bring your own apps (BYOA) and bring your own PC (BYOPC).

Employee-owned devices are sometimes sanctioned by the company and supported alongside devices that are owned by the business. In other cases, employee-owned devices are part of the parallel system known as shadow IT: hardware or software within an enterprise that is not supported by the organization’s central IT department.

	<h3><div>2.How have organisations responded to BYOD?</div></h3>

	Answer:In reference to increasing consumerization, this article investigates how organizations react to employees' adoption and use of personal devices at work, such as by incorporating innovative, individual, IT-driven changes into their corporate practices. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - Four in-depth, longitudinal case studies, conducted between 2006 and 2010, feature 92 interviews and observations to ensure triangulation. Findings - We identify three types of organizational reactions (induction, normalization, and regulation) that depend on specific dimensions and affect the nature of subsequent IT-based organizational change. Research limitations/implications - Continued research into the consumerization of IT can explore how it affects organizations today and whether different effects might arise in other contexts and with different kinds of organizations. Practical implications - Reversed IT adoption logics have deep consequences for organizations; companies could achieve great gains from them, if carefully considered and managed. Originality/value - This article addresses a topic that has been analyzed only scarcely and rarely, namely, the consumerization of IT and the tactics organizations use to incorporate user-driven IT innovation. Although this article presents only a few cases, it constitutes an initial attempt to explore this research area theoretically and investigate the ways organizations can harness employees' personal IT adoption logics to promote creative, IT-driven change in firms.

	<h3><div>3.How have organisations adapted to BYOD with networking?</div></h3>

	Answer:Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) is a vastly adapted policy in which companies allow their employees to use their own mobile devices for work. This decision brings several positives and negatives for a network environment
	Above all, security should be the main concern when adopting BYOD into a network. Employees will bring multiple devices using multiple operating systems connected to multiple wireless and service networks. Managing everything may require MDM software to reduce administrative levels of effort to take control and minimize security vulnerabilities.
	A company that already has a VoIP system that offers VoIP apps can enforce the app’s use for business calls. Employees can keep their personal and work-related calls separate and won’t have to rely on their personal voice plan and minutes. Company-purchased VoIP apps are useful for voice and video calls as well as file sharing. These apps should include user access authentication and authorization, such as a login and password, to increase security.

	<h3><div>4.What areas of risk have been identified for BYOD?</div></h3>

	Answer:1.Opportunities for Data Theft
BYOD policies make it easy to stay in contact with your employees. But what if they’re at the airport and send out a file over an unsecured Wi-Fi network? Think about the risks of exposing this information to hackers looking for access into critical company systems, which is especially prevalent in airports.
2.Malware Infiltration
Your employees use their devices to download all sorts of information and may not be careful about separating and securing valuable company data from everything else. What happens if they inadvertently download a mobile game with hidden malware or viruses? They could end up passing it right into your company network the next time they log in.
3.Potential Legal Issues
An organization’s reputation can be severely damaged if a security breach through an employee’s device leads to a leak of crucial information on your customers or business partners. That means possibly dealing with litigation from different parties.
4.Device Loss or Theft
An employee losing a device or having it stolen can go from a big inconvenience to a disaster for your entire company if they didn’t follow recommended company security protocols. What if they didn’t have a secure password for logging into company systems?
5.Poor Mobile Management
Employees can leave your company for any reason. How can you be sure former employees no longer have mobile access to company applications on their way out? How easy would it be for them or someone with access to their device to get back into an app or system?
6.Lack of Employee Training
Many security breaches come as a result of mistakes made by employees. They may not fully understand company requirements when it comes to securing their device.
7.Shadow IT
There’s also mounting concern with shadow IT, where information technology is managed outside of (and without the knowledge of) the company’s IT department. An Avanade survey reports that “one-third of tech purchases in a company are made by people who don’t report to the CIO.”

<h3><div>5.What does the future hold for BYOD?</div></h3>

Answer:1.Security

Most sensible businesses treat the integrity of their data very seriously and invest time and money in firewalls, password protection and anti-virus software. They are also likely to have maintenance arrangements in place that keep their security measures up to date.
Personal devices are unlikely to have this level of protection, which could lead to sensitive information falling into the wrong hands. In these circumstances employers could find themselves in breach of data protection laws unless they are able to demonstrate that they have made reasonable attempts to keep the information secure – such as having robust remote working security protocols or automated defence mechanisms in place.

2.Productivity
There is clear temptation for workers using their own devices in company time to be distracted by personal messages and notifications, which can impact adversely on productivity unless contracts of employment are explicit about what constitutes acceptable BYOD use.

3.Intellectual property (IP)
BYOD can lead to a company’s valuable IP being stored on an employee’s personal device – a potential risk if that employee leaves or is dismissed.
The law is clear that company data on a personal device belongs to the company and in most circumstances the copyright for work generated by an employee will also rest with the company.

4.GDPR
The principal change under GDPR will be the requirement for firms to draw up ‘privacy notices’ setting out clearly and comprehensively what data is collected, how and where it is stored, and who is able to access it.
Where information is downloaded onto personal devices, this will need to be fully explained and documented.
The introduction of the new legislation will undoubtedly add a layer of complexity onto the issue of BYOD, but it also represents a good opportunity for businesses to review their portfolio of information management policies and procedures to ensure they remain compliant.
